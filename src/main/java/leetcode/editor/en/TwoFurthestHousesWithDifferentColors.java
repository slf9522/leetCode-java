//There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifull
//y painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where col
//ors[i] represents the color of the ith house. 
//
// Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors. 
//
// The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is th
//e absolute value of x. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
//The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
//House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs
//(0 - 3) = 3.
//Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color
// 3 is green.
//The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
//House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs
//(0 - 4) = 4.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: colors = [0,1]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and hou
//se 1.
//House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs
//(0 - 1) = 1.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// n == colors.length 
// 2 <= n <= 100 
// 0 <= colors[i] <= 100 
// Test data are generated such that at least two houses have different colors.
